## Why NestSpace

- **No accessibility service required**: Interface observation, tapping, and text input are handled directly through channels inside the app.
- **No adb required**: Installing APKs, duplicating apps, organizing the desktop, and using the AI assistant can all be done directly on the phone.
- **No root required**: Install it like an ordinary app; it does not modify the system.
- **Broad Android version support**: Android 7.0 (API 24) and later are supported; 7.1, 15, 16, and 17 have all been verified.

## Limitations to know first

- **NestSpace is primarily for validating AI capabilities**: It is not a general-purpose compatibility container and does not guarantee the compatibility or security of installed apps. App hardening, native SDKs, and hot updates can all cause failures; feel free to open an issue when you encounter one.
- **There is a limit on how many virtual apps can run at once**: Limited by phone memory and container slots, at most 16 container processes can run simultaneously. They are managed automatically by default; when memory is tight, the least recently used background container is closed.

## Conventions

- In this documentation, "Space settings" refers to the Space settings icon on the desktop.
- "App management", "Model settings", and similar pages are secondary pages within Space settings.
- NestSpace is an experimental project focused on validating AI capabilities. It does not guarantee the compatibility or security of installed apps, and the number of simultaneously running apps is limited. See [Architecture & limitations](architecture.md) for details.
